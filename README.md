# The existence of this repository
I have learned a bunch of theories from lectures and could do the mathematical manipulation on paper, however, these theories and algorithms are only useful at a large scale when computers are used. Hence, this repository is aimed at covering these gaps and to gain some practical experiences. Besides, it would be such a pity to forget these wonderful theories and algorithms.
